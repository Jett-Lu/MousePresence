# MousePresence

MousePresence is a Python application that prevents a workstation from registering as idle or AFK (away from keyboard).
It works by moving the mouse pointer at configurable intervals in smooth, natural paths, simulating realistic user activity.
A graphical user interface (Tkinter) allows settings to be adjusted in real time.

## Features

* Graphical user interface built with Tkinter.
* Adjustable settings:

  * Interval between jiggle cycles (5–120 seconds).
  * Travel time for each jiggle (0.2–10 seconds).
  * Minimum and maximum number of waypoints per jiggle.
  * Edge margin to keep movements away from screen edges.
* Start, Pause, Stop, and "Move Now" controls.
* Log panel displaying jiggle events and status updates.
* Enlarged slider handles for ease of use.
* PyAutoGUI failsafe enabled (moving the mouse to a screen corner stops the program).

## Use Cases

* Prevents a computer from going idle, sleeping, or showing "away" status.
* Useful as an **anti-AFK tool**, as it moves the mouse in a way that resembles human movement.
* Suitable for workstations, long-running sessions, or systems that disconnect when idle.
